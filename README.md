# Online Store Application

## Description of the Project

This Java console application serves as an online store where users can view products, add them to their cart, and proceed with checkout. The purpose of this application is to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to shop for products virtually. The intended users are customers who want to browse and purchase products from the comfort of their own home.

The main functionality includes displaying a list of products available for purchase, allowing users to add products to their cart, displaying the contents of the cart, and enabling users to proceed with checkout by confirming their purchase.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want a functionality that can read from my product file and load the inventory to my app, so that I can keep track of all the stock in my store.
- As a user, I want my stock visible to my customers; displaying product id, name, and price, so that they can be able to make purchases, add to cart or remove from cart.
- As a user, I want a functionality that displays all the products to the customers and prompt them to select a product they want to add to their cart, so that they can populate their cart.
- As a user, I want a functionality that displays all products in a customer's cart and along with a subtotal, so that they can be able to track how much their total cost is going to be.
- As a user, I want a functionality that calculates the total price in a customer's cart, displays a summary and prompts them to confirm a purchase, so that I can collect a payment from a purchase.
